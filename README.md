# Python-PasswordGen
Basic Python program, to create a randomised password based on user input

The program asks the user to input various numbers for the number of characters in the desired password.

For example, 5 letters, 2 numbers, and 3 special characters.

The program firstly selects the amount of each type of character required at random and stores this value it then randomises the order of the stored value.
Therefore creating a randomised random character password based on user requirements.
